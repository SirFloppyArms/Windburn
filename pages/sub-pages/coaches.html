        <h2>Dave Lipchen</h2>
        <p>
          Dave’s coaching career has involved working with athletes of all ages, but has focused on the youth age groups 
          using the LTAD (Long Term Athlete Development) model to appropriately develop their abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          He developed the Manitoba Youth Triathlon Program in its entirety in 2008 and was the full-time Head Coach of 
          the Triathlon Manitoba Youth Team from 2008-2012, with the focus on developing high performance athletes from 
          10 to 18 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, Dave has recruited and developed many of Manitoba’s top youth athletes since 2008. Dave also 
          has been a competitive athlete since 1992. He is now the Head Coach and Director of the Windburn Multi-Sport 
          Academy made up of athletes aged 12 and up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windburn’s coached training sessions and individualized programs are designed and implemented by Head Coach, 
          Dave Lipchen. Dave partners with coaches at the Manta Swim Team, Manitoba Cycling Association, University of 
          Manitoba Bison’s Track Team and Peacock Endurance Project to ensure athletes receive a holistic training 
          environment from experts in each sport. Dave’s coaching style involves daily communication with each athlete 
          to help monitor well-being, ensure adequate recovery and prevent injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emphasis on two-way communication also maintains motivation, engagement and focus on daily training tasks 
          as well as long-term goals. Dave is an athlete and, thus, actively participates in all training sessions to 
          inspire athletes to train and compete at their highest level.
