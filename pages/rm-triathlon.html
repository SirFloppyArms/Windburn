                <p>Lifeguards in boats as well as kayakers monitor the swimmers as they make their way around the course. Cheers from the enthusiastic crowd lining the beach carries across the water and encourages the athletes along the way.</p>
                <p>The Olympic athletes complete a two-lap route, while the Sprint athletes complete one lap. Upon completion of the swim, athletes exit the water and run up the stone stairs past the cheering crowd and swim split timers, into the scenic transition zone.</p>

                <h3>Transition</h3>
                <p>The transition zone is a critical part of the race. Upon exiting the water, athletes run approximately 200m along a marked path to enter the transition area where their bikes and gear are positioned.</p>
                <p>The transition is organized into clearly marked rows. Your bike number corresponds to specific rack locations. All racking is first-come, first-served (except elite seeding). The transition zone features proper spacing to prevent congestion and confusion during the race.</p>
                <p>Athletes must exit the transition zone using the designated bike exit road. The path is clearly marked and monitored by volunteers. All bikes must be mounted before leaving the transition area.</p>
                <p>Upon finishing the run, athletes re-enter the transition zone from a separate entrance, deposit their running gear, and proceed to the finish line area.</p>
                <p>A detailed transition diagram is provided in your race kit. Familiarize yourself with your assigned rack location during race check-in.</p>

                <h3>Bike</h3>
                <p>Once exiting the transition zone, riders mount their bikes. A short cycle along Columbine Street takes athletes to the No. 10 Highway, where a left-hand turn, marshalled by volunteers and the local RCMP, directs the athletes north on an out and back course.</p>
                <p>Considered one of the most scenic rides on the prairies, the cycling course cuts through the RMNP’s boreal forest. Riders are in awe of the mosaic of mountain and prairie landscapes, which is enhanced by frequent sightings of deer, moose, bears and the occasional lynx or wolf.</p>
                <p>Both the Olympic and Sprint participants pass the famous Clear Lake Golf Course and embark on the first climb of the day. Once Sprint athletes reach 10 km, they turn around and head back to the town site.</p>
                <p>The Olympic athletes continue on and are treated to a beautiful ride, capped by a panoramic view of Clear Lake just before they embark on a gentle 5 km climb to the turnaround. Upon return to the town site, riders prepare for their second transition as they glide past the enthusiastic spectators along Columbine Street.</p>

                <h3>Bike – Profile</h3>
                <p>Understanding the elevation profile of the bike course will help you pace your effort and prepare for the climbing sections. The course begins at the transition zone (elevation 630m) and gradually ascends through the first 3km.</p>
                <p>The most significant elevation gain occurs between km 8-15, where the road climbs steadily toward the park's ridge area. This is typically the toughest section of all bike distances. After km 15, the course descends and rolls through forested sections with variable gradient.</p>
                <p><strong>Super Sprint Profile:</strong> Minimal elevation change, ideal for beginners and those wanting a confidence-building ride.</p>
                <p><strong>Sprint Profile:</strong> Approximately 180m total elevation gain with manageable climbs. The final 2km returns to lower elevation with a slight downhill finish.</p>

                <h3>Run</h3>
                <p>Runners will exit the transition zone and head up Columbine and left on Ta-wa-pit for the first hill climb. For the next 2 km runners will pass by the seasonal residence cottagers cheering, keeping the focus off the hard bike and inspiring them on.</p>
                <p>Please see the Duathlon Run Course map for the two run routes.</p>
                <p>The Sprint runners make the turnaround at Deep Bay and head back to the finish line via Wasagaming Drive to the Lakeshore path. Olympic runners continue along the closed road for another 2 km towards the golf course before their turnaround. Shortly after the sprint turnaround runners head down to the Lakeshore path and are met by the view of the lake and some welcome shade to keep the engine cool.</p>
                <p>With 1 km to go the trail climbs up and a vast view of Clear Lake and the sounds of the transition zone can be heard enticing them to speed up for the last push to the line. As the runners approach the end of this lakeshore path, they run into the finishing shoot inside the transition zone to the finish line where all the fun began a short time ago.</p>

                <h3>Run – Super Sprint & Duathlon</h3>
                <p>The Super Sprint 2.5km run is an excellent introduction to triathlon. This distance is achievable for first-time athletes while still providing a meaningful running challenge after the swim and bike legs.</p>
                <p>For duathlon participants (bike-run only), the 2.5km run concludes the race and serves as a final sprint to the finish. This course uses the same trail system as the triathlon distances but represents only a single loop on the primary trail.</p>
                <p>The terrain is well-marked and relatively forgiving compared to the longer distances. One aid station is positioned at approximately the 1km mark. The final section features a gradual descent toward the finish line celebration area.</p>
                <p>This distance is perfect for building confidence before attempting longer distances. Focus on maintaining steady effort and enjoying the experience. The scenic finish line provides excellent spectator viewing areas.</p>
                <p>After finishing, proceed directly to the finish line area where you'll receive a finisher's medal, refreshment beverages, and access to the race festival with food vendors and celebration activities.</p>
